# WESM Price Prediction

An end-to-end machine learning project for predicting electricity spot market prices in the Philippines. The target variable is the **Generator Weighted Average Price (GWAP)** for the Luzon region at 5-minute Real-Time Dispatch (RTD) intervals, sourced from the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) operated by IEMOP.

---

## Overview

The project covers the full ML pipeline — from raw market data ingestion to model evaluation — and benchmarks five model families across both regression and classification formulations of the same underlying problem.

**Key findings:**
- The best regression model (Polynomial ElasticNet) achieves **RMSE ≈ ₱930/MWh, R² ≈ 0.675** on the held-out test set.
- The best classification model (Multiclass Logistic Regression) achieves **Macro F1 = 0.764, ROC-AUC = 0.947** for detecting Normal / Negative / Positive Spike price states.
- Across all architectures, the dominant predictor is `GWAP_Lag_1` (price 5 minutes ago), confirming GWAP is strongly autoregressive. LSTMs with residual stacking approach but do not surpass classical linear models on this dataset.
- Rare positive spikes (GWAP > ₱10,000/MWh) remain the hardest prediction target — 8–11× higher RMSE than the normal price range — revealing that the bottleneck is feature availability, not model complexity.

## Notebooks

| Notebook | Description |
|---|---|
| `01_ETL_Preprocessing` | Ingests GWAP, RTD Regional Summaries, and Outage Schedules. Filters to Luzon (`CLUZ`), engineers `energy_shortage_mw`, and outputs a single merged dataset. |
| `02_EDA` | Analyzes price distributions, temporal patterns, feature correlations, and documents negative GWAP events (a valid market phenomenon per WESM PDM). |
| `03a_VanillaLinearRegression` | Trains and evaluates a vanilla OLS baseline. Includes segmented error analysis by price regime. |
| `03b_PolynomialRidge` | Expands to degree-2 polynomial features and regularizes with Ridge and ElasticNet. Best classical regression model. |
| `04_MulticlassLogisticRegression` | Classifies each interval as Normal (0–₱5,000), Negative (≤ ₱0), or Positive Spike (> ₱5,000). Best overall classifier. |
| `05_NeuralNetwork` | Trains a configurable feedforward network using the custom `NeuralNetwork` and `DataLoader` classes. |
| `06_LSTM` | Trains an LSTM with hyperparameter search over lookback window and hidden units. Also tests residual stacking, price-change decomposition, and an LSTM classifier. |

## Features

The 16 input features used across models:

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| `energy_demand_mw` | MW energy requirement (demand) |
| `energy_supply_mw` | MW energy generation (supply) |
| `reserve_demand_mw` | MW reserve requirement |
| `reserve_supply_mw` | MW reserve availability |
| `outage_count` | Number of scheduled generator outages |
| `GWAP_Lag_1` | GWAP 5 minutes ago (strongest predictor) |
| `GWAP_Lag_12` | GWAP 1 hour ago |
| `GWAP_Lag_288` | GWAP 24 hours ago |
| `hour_sin`, `hour_cos` | Cyclical encoding of hour-of-day |
| `dow_sin`, `dow_cos` | Cyclical encoding of day-of-week |
| `month_sin`, `month_cos` | Cyclical encoding of month |
| `is_weekend` | Binary flag for weekends |
| `is_peak_hour` | Binary flag for peak demand hours |

> `energy_shortage_mw` (demand − supply) is excluded from model inputs due to perfect multicollinearity with the demand and supply features.

## Getting Started

### 1. Get the Data

The project uses 5 months of WESM data (Oct 2025 – Feb 2026). The IEMOP website only hosts the latest 3 months, so use the archived link:

**[Download Full Dataset (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bBBfN9HHeusgjcAjRgM8dC-t4AMN0ijE?usp=sharing)**

- To run notebooks **02 onwards**, download `final_dataset_csv` and place the extracted CSV in the root folder.
- To run **01_ETL_Preprocessing** from scratch, download the `raw_data` folder and extract it as:

```
raw_data/
├── GWAP/
├── RTD_Regional/
└── Outages/
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib torch tensorflow jupyter
```

### 3. Run the Notebooks

Open notebooks in order (01 → 06) in Jupyter, or skip to any model notebook using the pre-processed CSV:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
